## Semantic Versioning Rules (A.B.C-rcX)

- **New Features**: Increment `A` (major) for major changes or incompatible features, `B` (minor) for minor changes (mostly compatible with previous versions).
- **Consistency**: Main library and wrappers use the same `A` and `B` versioning.
- **Updates**: `C` changes are fixes and updates without new features; `C` doesn't need to be synchronized between library and wrappers.
- **Release Candidate (rc)**: `X` represents consecutive release candidates for a given version.
- **Before Official Release**: Release as `A.B.C-rcX` before final release; changes to new API are possible and update `X`.
- **Finalizing a Version**: Release stable version when library and wrappers are fully compatible.
- **Minor Changes (B)**: Increment `B` for small features, replace older functionality, and mark deprecated functions.
- **Major Changes (A)**: Increment `A` for introducing major changes or features.
